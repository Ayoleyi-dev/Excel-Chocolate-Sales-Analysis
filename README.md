# Excel: Chocolate Sales Analysis

This project is a complete analysis of chocolate sales data, performed entirely within Microsoft Excel. The goal was to clean the raw data, analyze sales performance, and build an interactive dashboard to identify key insights.

## Project Files

* **`chocolate sales.xlsx - Chocolate Sales.csv`**: The raw, original sales data.
* **`Chocolate_Sales_Analysis.xlsx`**: The final Excel file containing all cleaning, analysis (Pivot Tables), and the interactive dashboard.

## Analysis & Key Insights

I used Pivot Tables to analyze the data, and here are my main findings:

* **Top Product:** [Write your #1 product here]
* **Top Market:** [Write your #1 country here]
* **Busiest Month:** [Write the month with the most sales here]

## Tools Used

* **Microsoft Excel**
* **Excel Tables** (for data formatting)
* **Pivot Tables & PivotCharts** (for analysis)
* **Excel Dashboards & Slicers** (for interactive visualization)
